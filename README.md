# The dream
### The mission   
Make a currency converter using PHP   
### :euro: Must-haves:   
- Pick your next travel destination and check the exchange rate: local currency / Euros.   
- Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate (use a form), and it'll tell you the price in Euros. A simple calculation will do, no need to get updated rates from external API's.  
- Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)
